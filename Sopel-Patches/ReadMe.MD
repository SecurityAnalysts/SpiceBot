# Sopel Patches
In this folder you'll find any little fixes we've written to 'help' the bot handle tasks more efficiently.<br>
Things like the db.py file handles int/string conversions better than the default.<br>

At some point in the future this will be rewritten again to handle MySQL instead of SQLite as it is more robust.
