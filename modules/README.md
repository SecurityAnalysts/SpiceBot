This folder contains all the modules in an organized fashion

Modules in IT, Bot, and Tools do not pass through the prerun check.

All other modules pass through a prerun check in SpiceBotShared.py to verify that they can run in a given channel, and by the user that triggered it.

Modules in the dev folder have no effect on the "master" channel.

Fully functional modules are located in the main folder.
